#Â Troubleshoting

## Running bitcoind on macOS

When running Bitcoin scripts on macOS, you may experience an error due to the fact that it is not a signed application. To fix this issue, you can run the following commands:

```bash
codesign -s - .bitcoin/bin/bitcoind
codesign -s - .bitcoin/bin/bitcoin-cli
```
